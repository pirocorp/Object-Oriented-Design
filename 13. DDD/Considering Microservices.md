# Considering Microservices

Microservices Basic Tenets

- Self-contained
- No dependency on other microservices
- Independently deployable
- Changing internals should not break communications

Each **Microservice** should have a boundary around it, and within that boundary should focus on a specific set of behaviors that fits its model. Each **Microservice** can be considered its **Bounded Context**, and it has its terminology or even language for how it is designed.

It is not unusual for teams to treat individual **Microservices** like **Bounded Contexts** with their own **Ubiquitous Language** and everything else that goes along with the **Bounded Contexts**. **Bounded context is not necessarily equal to a microservice**


# Considering the UI in the Domain Design

Is it an anti-pattern to think about the UI when we are focused on the domain?
**- NO!**

The demands of the user interface can impact parts of your application.
